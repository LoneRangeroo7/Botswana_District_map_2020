# Botswana_District_map_2020
This is a short program of the Botswana map with the district polygons. There's a panda in there you can use to add other features and  layers for your particular geospatial application.

There are a few files that have the actual polygon maps for the Botswana map in excel formate. I used "gadm40_BWA_1" in the program, it has the districts and their capitals nicely laid out. The other files gadm40_BWA_0, gadm40_BWA_2 have other features which maybe of interest to you.

In the original program I used my google drive to load the files, so you can repurpose the code, and paste the path and filename in your drive or network location. 

Files other than the program are zipped in "gadm40_BWA_shp".
